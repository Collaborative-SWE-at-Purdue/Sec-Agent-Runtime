# A Security-Constrained Agent Runtime

This repository contains the **Agent Runtime**: a security-constrained execution environment that deterministically mediates between a Large Language Model (LLM) and real-world tools.

The runtime enforces safety and correctness through two core mechanisms:
1. **Explicit policy enforcement** over agent actions
2. **Systematic verification hooks** that enable analysis, auditing, and replay

The runtime is designed to act as a strict boundary between untrusted agent intent and trusted system execution.

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please read:
- the [documentation](/docs)
- the [system specifications](/system-specs)

These documents define the runtime’s trust boundaries, proposal model, and execution guarantees.

## Repository Structure & Related Projects

This project is intentionally split across **two repositories**, each with a distinct responsibility.

### Agent Runtime (this repository)
- Implements the core runtime logic
- Defines the agent proposal envelope and handling pipeline
- Performs validation, policy evaluation, and controlled action execution
- Produces structured logs and execution outcomes

This repository is the **system under test**.

### SARE — Secure Agent Runtime Evaluations
Evaluation, simulation, and analysis tooling for the Agent Runtime live in a **separate repository**.

SARE provides:
- adversarial and malformed proposal testing
- multi-agent and conflict simulations
- performance benchmarking
- structured log ingestion, metrics, and reporting

The separation keeps the runtime implementation clean while allowing evaluation tooling to evolve independently.

## Collaborative SWE @ Purdue — Shared Repository Hosting

Student-run software engineering projects developed as part of coursework at Purdue University.

In addition to industry-standard software engineering practices, these projects emphasize:
- clear architectural boundaries,
- explicit responsibility ownership,
- and meaningful collaboration between developers.

<br/>

**This organization is used to host team-based academic projects and is not an official Purdue University organization.**
