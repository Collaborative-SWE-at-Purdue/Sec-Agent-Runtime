# A Security-Constrained Agent Runtime
This is the repository behind a security-constrained agent runtime, which aims to build a security-constrained agent runtime that deterministically mediates between an LLM and real tools. <br/>
The runtime will accomplish this in 2 ways:
  1. Enforcing explicit policies
  2. Enabling systematic verification.
