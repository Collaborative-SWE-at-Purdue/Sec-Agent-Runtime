# Project Dependencies

This project relies on a minimal set of high-quality libraries to ensure strict validation and type safety without bloating the runtime.

## Runtime Dependencies
*Libraries required for the application to run in production.*

- **[zod](https://zod.dev/)**: Used for strict schema validation of Agent Proposals and Responses. It allows us to define "Field Constraints" as code and enforce security policies (like blocking `.sh` files) at the type level.

## Development Dependencies
*Libraries used for building, testing, and type-checking.*

- **[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: The core language for the project.
- **[vitest](https://vitest.dev/)**: The test runner used to verify our security logic. It is compatible with TypeScript out of the box and requires zero configuration.
- **[@types/node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node)**: Provides type definitions for built-in Node.js modules (like `crypto` for UUID generation).

Installation Commands
